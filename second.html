    <h2>
    	3 Reasons Why Dressel's Swim Should Blow Your Mind
    </h2>
    <ol>
    <li>
   Florida’s Caeleb Dressel has once again made history. Dressel, owner of the 10 fastest times in history, successfully defended his 50 free title at the 2018 NCAA Championships as he raced to the wall in 17.63. That makes him 4-for-4 in the 50 free throughout his NCAA career. His individual swim tonight comes after he split a 17.81 on the leadoff split of the 200 free relay to kick off the session.
    </li>
    <li>
    Dressel literally won the race by a second, as NC State’s Ryan Held was very fast to take 2nd in 18.64. Minnesota’s Bowen Becker, the 8th fastest man ever, was just shy of his best to take 3rd tonight. Cal freshman Ryan Hoffer, the 9th fastest man ever, tied for 5th with Auburn’s Zach Apple in 18.97
    </li>
    <li>
    Dressel has clearly mastered this event, based on his metrics. With the exception of his DPS on the second lap, all of his metrics were far above average compared to the rest of the field. On the first lap, he produced the highest DPS and stroke index, while simultaneously pulling the fastest stroke rate. This ensured no one could come close to his speed or split. And although he dropped his DPS on the second lap, he still maintained the fastest stroke rate and speed coming back. Overall combining stroke speed, length, and power, to deliver extremely efficient strokes at an exceptionally fast rate.
