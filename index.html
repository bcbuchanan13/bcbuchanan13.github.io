      Texas won the 2018 men’s championship in a nail biter over Cal and Indiana. Time to examine how it happened from every conceivable angle. Texas finished with 449 points to Cal’s 437.5 and Indiana’s 422. Compared to the psych sheet Texas picked up 46 swimming points, Cal picked up 97 (most of any team), and Indiana lost 26.5. Indiana were basically level with the psych sheet until today when they dropped 26 points whereas Cal had their best day gaining 46 points. NC State the pre meet leader on the psych sheet matched the psych sheet total exactly, but their lack of diving points doomed their title hopes.

That makes him 4-for-4 in the 50 free throughout his NCAA career. His individual swim tonight comes after he split a 17.81 on the leadoff split of the 200 free relay to kick off the session......
