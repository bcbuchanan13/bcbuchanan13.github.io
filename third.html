  	Indiana’s Ian Finnerty made history on Friday night at the 2018 Men’s NCAA Championships. Finnerty smashed his lifetime best to win the 100 breast, clocking in at 49.69. That makes Finnerty the fastest man ever and the first man to break 50 seconds. Before tonight, Florida’s Caeleb Dressel had come the closest to breaking that barrier with his 50.03 from SECs.

  	Finnerty’s American Record and NCAA Record tonight took about 4 tenths off the previous record. He was over a second faster than anyone else in the field tonight, as Cal’s Connor Hoppe finished 2nd in 51.16. Finnerty will now get ready to help Indiana compete for a sweep of the medley relays in tonight’s 200 medley relay finals.

  <p>
  	This blistering sub-50 swim puts Finnerty in a class of his own surpassing past greats of the likes of Dressel, Licon, Cordes, and former teammake Cody Miller. Perhaps more impressive is the improvement that Finnerty has made since joining the star-studded breaststroke group at IU. Just 2 years ago, Finnerty was at the back of the pack at NCAA with a 54 second 100 breast.
